COURSE DESCRIPTION: This course explores the person and work of Jesus Christ the incarnate Son
of God according to biblical revelation. In that light we also consider the
nature of the salvation accomplished and offered in and through Jesus Christ
and by the Holy Spirit. This will include reflecting on the nature of human
beings, of evil, and the inherent effects of sin. Issues of predestination and
how we receive and participate in that saving relationship with our Triune
God are studied.

TERMINATION DATE OF AGREEMENT:  The Course Enrollment Agreement ends twenty weeks after the course start date. 

COURSE CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY: Cancellation requests must be conveyed in writing to the Registrar and course professor.  This will ensure any refund owed to you.  Refunds will be given within 30 days of requests. [See refund policy below.]

1.	All tuition must be paid at time of registration. Students who cancel before the first class will receive a full refund of tuition paid.  Class lectures are posted each Monday.
2.	For students who cancel during the first week, the refund of tuition shall be 100% of the tuition paid. 
3.	If a student withdraws from a course after the first week, the refund shall be 80% of the tuition paid. 
4.	If a student withdraws from a course after the second week, the refund shall be 70% of the tuition paid.  
5.	If a student withdraws from a course after the third week, the refund will be 60% of the tuition paid.  
6.	If a student withdraws from a course after the fourth week, the refund will be 50% of the tuition paid. 
7.	If a student withdraws from a course after the fifth week, the refund will be 40% of the tuition paid.

Refunds for audits are at the same weekly percentage as refunds for courses taken for credit. For example, if a student paid $367.50 for a course and withdrew in the fifth week, the refund would be 50 percent of the tuition paid: $367.50 x .5 = $183.75.
