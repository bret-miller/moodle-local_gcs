# GCS Program Management #

This plugin provides student and program management capabilities in Moodle.

With this plugin, school administration can track programs offered, the number of 
required courses for each program, which courses are permitted for credits in the
program, student information, school terms, classes offered, classes taken, basic
scholarship management, enrollment agreements, and programs completed along with 
some basic reporting.
